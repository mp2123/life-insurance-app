A growing number of students at top universities like
Harvard and MIT are walking away from their degrees
amid fears about artificial general intelligence, or AGI.
Experts from OpenAl and Google DeepMind warn that
AGI, capable of performing most human tasks, could
arrive before 2030. For some, that prediction is enough
to abandon traditional education and dedicate
themselves to Al safety, regulation, or launching tech
startups.

“| worried | wouldn't even live to graduate because of
AGI," says Alice Blair, a former MIT student now at the
Center for Al Safety. Many others are concerned about
the impact on their future careers, with surveys showing
that half of Harvard students believe their professions
could be automated in just a few years.

Not all students see this as a threat. Some view the Al
revolution as an unprecedented opportunity.
Entrepreneurs like Michael Tuell and Brendan Foody left
MIT and Georgetown to build startups now valued at
billions, seizing the chance to shape the future of Al.
Jared Manter, another former student, echoes the
sentiment: “There's a short window to grab the steering
wheel.”

This wave of early exits highlights the massive impact
AGI is expected to have on society, education, and
careers. For a generation standing at the crossroads of
technology and humanity, the Al era is rewriting the
rules of ambition, innovation, and survival.

Research documents from other PhD professors
are still saying that we are 50 years away from AGI
as LLM models have hit a wall. There is a lot of Al
propaganda click bait to sell products that don’t
even use Al. It's a cash grab people need to wake
up.
