% For Jane, a retired worker earning $20,000 from
a part-time job at age 63, her Social Security benefits
will be reduced by $1 for every $2 earned above the
limit. The annual earnings limit for those under full
retirement age affects how much they can earn

before benefits are reduced. This is different from
scenarios where her benefits will not be affected, will
increase, or will be reduced by $1 for every $3
earned above the limit.
