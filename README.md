## 🎯 Project Vision & Philosophy

This ecosystem is designed to push the boundaries of modern web development by combining **high-end performance visuals**, **AI-first workflows**, and **data-driven architectures**. 

### 💡 Core Principles
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key):** All AI integrations use the "Bring Your Own Key" model. This ensures zero API costs for the host while providing users with privacy and the choice of their preferred AI models (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).
- **120Hz Visual Mastery:** UI components like the `CardScanner` are optimized with `useAnimationFrame` and `useMotionValue` to achieve sub-pixel smooth motion, perfectly synced with high-refresh-rate displays.
- **Privacy & Portability:** User preferences and AI keys are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring a "lite" backend and maximum user control.
- **Professional Precision:** Whether studying for a state licensing exam or mastering a complex cocktail, the apps provide high-fidelity content and intuitive interactive tools.

## ⚙️ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

### 1. Database Operations (Prisma)
To avoid IPv6/Transaction pooling hangs with Supabase, **ALWAYS** use the **Session Pooler (Port 5432)** for CLI commands:
```bash
# In an app directory:
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Seeding Data
- **Insurance:** Seeding is managed via custom direct-access scripts in `prisma/scripts/`.
- **Mixology:** Use `node prisma/seed-bartender.js` to populate the recipe and product tables.

### 3. AI Key Configuration
Users must provide their own API keys via the **Settings** button in the AI chat interface. These are stored in `localStorage` and never touch the server.
